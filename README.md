# Book-Recommendation-System

The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning revolution has shown compelling developments in
the application programming interfaces (APIs). Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a billiondollar
market. Machine learning + Customer Experience (CX) enable speedy systems to overtake
manual models and increase customer satisfaction.

The primary objective of this project is to build a book recommendation system based on the various
features of the dataset. Feature correlation has time and again provided a major hypothesis drive in
a plethora of big data studies. We also propose to perform data analysis by creating various
visualizations to observe relations between the attributes of the dataset, if any. This project is based
on the Collaborative filtering idea of Spark MLlib.
